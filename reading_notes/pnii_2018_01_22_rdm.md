# PNII: Visual System (2018-01-22 & 2018-01-29, Ragsdale)
**See [1](../lecture_notes/pnii_2018_01_22_rdm.md), [2a](../lecture_notes/pnii_2018_01_29_emd.md), and [2b](../lecture_notes/pnii_2018_01_29_rdm.md) for lecture notes on this topic.**

Chapter 25 is required; chapters 26-29 are recommended.

## Chapter 25: The constructive nature of visual processing
### Visual perception is a constructive process
* *Constructive* visual processing: vision reproduces (constructs) 3D world from 2D information on retina by analyzing and parsing information, not adding together visual components
* *Gestalt* (German): literal, configuration or form; brain processes information based on expectations and context

### Visual perception is mediated by the geniculostriate pathway
An incredibly concise/pared down description of how information goes from retina &rarr; brain (refer to lecture notes above for a more detailed walkthrough). See Figures 25-5, 25-6 for good pictorial descriptions. Including a freely reusable (but not quite as detailed) stand-in image here:

### Form, color, motion, and depth are processed in discrete areas of the cerebral cortex
* Brodmann areas only partially correspond to functionally distinct regions (e.g., BA17 = V1, BA18 = V2, BA19 = lots of things)
* Ventral/dorsal pathways send information from V1 to higher cortex
    * Pathways are interconnected
    * All higher regions are reciprocally connected with lower regions
    * Comprise hierarchical set of areas delineated by:
        * Recreation of visual hemifields from inputs (becomes progressively more distorted as further up processing)
        * Functional properties (e.g., MT/V5 sensitive to movement)
* Dorsal pathway &rarr; parietal cortex (directs movement)
    * IPS: represents points in space that are targets of eye movements/reaching
        * Lesions: unilateral neglect
* Ventral pathway Temporal lobe
    * ITL: stores info about shapes/identities of objects
        * Lesions: prosopagnosia

### The receptive fields of neurons at successive relays in an afferent pathway provide clues to how the brain analyzes visual form
* Receptive fields with center-surround organization are either *on-center* or *off-center*
    * The surround is oppositely signed (on-center = off-surround)
    * Helps to encode information about contrast
* **Eccentricity**: position of a receptive field relative to the fovea (measured in degrees)
    * Receptive fields in fovea ~0.1&deg; and in periphery up to 10&deg;
    * Cortical space &propto; eccentricity
* Receptive field organization changes through visual pathways, indicative of how information is processed
    * Center-surround &rarr; columnar receptive field = highlight orientation of contours

### The visual cortex is organized into columns of specialized neurons
Legit just go look at all the figures in this section. The illustrator for this book deserves a goddamn medal.

* **Ocular dominance columns**: columnar arrangement of V1 neurons reflecting segregation of inputs from LGN based on ipsilateral/contralateral stimulation, repeating ~750-1000&mu;m
* **Hypercolumn**: column of neurons that encompasses orientation preference for entire 180&deg;, repeating ~750&mu;m
    * Criss-crossed with ocular dominance columns
    * Form parallel stripes / pinwheels across cortical surface
* **Blobs/interblobs**: poor orientation selectivity but strong color preferences
    * Embedded *within* orientation/ocular dominance columns
    * Identified with chytochrome oxidase histochemical labeling
    * Provide information about surfaces rather than edges
* Columnar system serves as substrate for:
    * **Serial processing**: successive connections from V1 &rarr; higher cortex
    * **Parallel processing**: overlapping subset of connections that process form/color/movement
    * Convers advantages: minimizes communication distance, economizes brain volume/maximizes processing speed

### Intrinsic cortical circuits transform neural information
* Parvocellular layers of LGN project to cortical layer IVC&beta;, magnocellular layers project to cortical layer IVC&alpha;
* *Tons* of recurrent/feedback connections; 10x more connections from cortex to LGN than from LGN to cortex
    * We have *no clue* what these connections do
* Some neurons travel parallel to cortical surface within each layer (horizontal connections)
    * Help integrate information over large areas of visual field/components
* Integration also occurs natural as info ascends the visual pathway (see: &uarr; receptive field size), and maybe via feedback connections

### Visual information is represented by a variety of neural codes
* Need inputs from *multiple* neurons in order to accurately assess stimulus properties &rarr; **population code**
    * Most prevalently modeled by **vector averaging**
* Neurons have a bell-curve response pattern; respond most prevalently to one orientation/color/whatever, but will also respond to bits around that
    * Treat information from neuron as a weighted vector, and then average/sum across population
* Variability to repeated presentations also important
    * Neurons most sensitive along flank of tuning curve, where small changes in stimulus make BIG difference in response
    * Making small changes to stimulus can allow us to determine relative # of neurons responding based on this fact
* **Distributed code**: ensembles of neurons required to represent an object; individual neurons represent parts and may participant in many different ensembles
    * That is, neurons DON'T represent entire objects in a single neuron
        * No "grandmother" or "pontifical" cells
* Potential for information to be carried along neurons via temporal activity; unclear as of yet

### An overall view
Again, read the above stuff for the overall view.
