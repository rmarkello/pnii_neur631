# PNII: Olfactory System (2018-02-05, Ragsdale)

Chapter 32 is required.

## Chapter 32: Smell and taste: the chemical senses

Certain features of chemosensation have been conserved across species, while others are specialized adaptions.
In this chapter we consider how chemosensation is achieved in the brain in a variety of animal species.

### A large number of olfactory receptor proteins initiate the sense of smell

Bipolar, olfactory ensory neurons are embedded in a specialized olfactory epithelium that lines part of nasal cavity.
These neurons are relatively short-lived, and so are replaced every 30-60 days from a supporting layer of basal stem cells.

The dendrites of these neurons project into cilia whose specialized receptors detect odorants.
The axons of these sensory neurons project through cribriform plate, a perforated region in the skull above the nasal cavity.
The axons then synapse in the olfactory bulb, the first relay in the olfactory pathway.

#### Mammals share a large family of odorant receptors

The number of odorant receptor varies by species, with humans having approximately 350 and mice approximately 1000.

Odorant receptors belong to the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily, but have high variability in amino acid sequence.
This is especially true in several transmembrane domains, providing a possible basis for variability in the odorant binding pocket-- broadening the array of potential binding odorant ligands.

A second, smaller family of chemosensory receptors known as trace amine-associated receptors (TAARs), are G protein-coupled, but their protein sequence is unrelated to that of odorant receptors.

TAARs recognize volatile amines. It has been suggested that this small receptor family is important in the detection of social cues.

#### Different combinations of receptors encode different odorants

Odorants elicit different neural responses in two ways:
1. Each olfactory sensory neuron expresses only one odorant receptor gene and therefore one type of receptor.
2. Each receptor recognizes multiple odorants, and conversely each odorant is detected by different types of receptor.

This combinatorial coding of odorants greatly expands the discriminatory power of the olfactory system.

Interestingly, even odorants with nearly identical structures are recognized by different combinations of receptors, and a change in concentration of an odorant can also change the perceived odor.

### Olfactory information is transformed along the pathway to the brain

#### Odorants are encoded in the nose by dispersed neurons

Different types of odorant receptors are expressed in several coarse zones of the olfactory epithelium of the mouse (though a specific odorant may be recognized by receptors in several different zones).

Neurons with the same receptor are randomly scattered within the zone so that neurons with different receptors are interspersed.

#### Sensory inputs in the olfactory bulb are arranged by receptor type

Axons of olfactory sensory neurons project to the ipsilateral olfactory bulb, terminating on dendrites of olfactory bulb neurons within bundles of neuropil called glomeruli.

In the glomeruli, neurons make connections with three types of neurons: mitral, tufted, and periglomerular interneurons.

In each glomerulus the axons of several thousand sensory neurons converge on the dendrites of approximately 40 to 50 relay neurons, resulting in a 100-fold decrease in neurons carrying olfactory information.

Because each odorant is recognized by a unique combination of receptor types, each odorant also activates a particular combination of glomeruli in the olfactory bulb. At the same time, just as an odorant receptor recognizes multiple odorants, a single glomerulus is activated by more than one odorant.

This organization is advantageous because:
1. The 100-fold decrease increases sensitivity to odors at low concentrations.
2. The neural code for an odorant is maintained over time.

Glomeruli are encircled by periglomerular interneurons that receive excitatory inputs from sensory axons and by granule cell interneurons that receive excitatory inputs from basal dendrites of mitral and tufted cells. These two cell types provide signal modulation and lateral inhibition, respectively.

#### The olfactory bulb transmits information to the olfactory cortex

The olfactory cortex comprises five main areas:
1. The anterior olfactory nucleus
2. The anterior and posterior cortical nuclei of the amygdala
3. The olfactory tubercle
4. Part of the entorhinal cortex
5. The piriform cortex


#### Output from the olfactory cortex reaches higher cortical and limbic areas
#### Olfactory acuity varies in humans

### Odors elicit characteristic innate behaviors

#### Pheromones are detected in two olfactory structures
#### Invertebrate olfactory systems can be used to study odor coding and behavior
#### The anatomy of the insect olfactory system resembles that of vertebrates
#### Olfactory cues elicit stereotyped behaviors and physiological responses in the nematode
#### Strategies for olfaction have evolved rapidly
