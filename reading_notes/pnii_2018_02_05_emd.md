# PNII: Olfactory System (2018-02-05, Ragsdale)

Chapter 32 is required.

## Chapter 32: Smell and taste: the chemical senses

Certain features of chemosensation have been conserved across species, while others are specialized adaptions.
In this chapter we consider how chemosensation is achieved in the brain in a variety of animal species.

### A large number of olfactory receptor proteins initiate the sense of smell

Bipolar, olfactory ensory neurons are embedded in a specialized olfactory epithelium that lines part of nasal cavity.
These neurons are relatively short-lived, and so are replaced every 30-60 days from a supporting layer of basal stem cells.

The dendrites of these neurons project into cilia whose specialized receptors detect odorants.
The axons of these sensory neurons project through cribriform plate, a perforated region in the skull above the nasal cavity.
The axons then synapse in the olfactory bulb, the first relay in the olfactory pathway.

#### Mammals share a large family of odorant receptors



#### Different combinations of receptors encode different odorants

### Olfactory information is transformed along the pathway to the brain

#### Odorants are encoded in the nose by dispersed neurons
#### Sensory inputs in the olfactory bulb are arranged by receptor type
#### The olfactory bulb transmits information to the olfactory cortex
#### Output from the olfactory cortex reaches higher cortical and limbic areas
#### Olfactory acuity varies in humans

### Odors elicit characteristic innate behaviors

#### Pheromones are detected in two olfactory structures
#### Invertebrate olfactory systems can be used to study odor coding and behavior
#### The anatomy of the insect olfactory system resembles that of vertebrates
#### Olfactory cues elicit stereotyped behaviors and physiological responses in the nematode
#### Strategies for olfaction have evolved rapidly

### The gustatory system controls the sense of taste

#### Taste has five submodalities or qualities
#### Taste detection occurs in taste buds
#### Each taste is detected by a distinct sensory transduction mechanism and distinct population of taste cells
#### Sensory neurons carry taste information from the taste buds to the brain
#### Taste information is transmitted from the thalamus to the gustatory cortex
#### Perception of flavor depends on gustatory, olfactory, and somatosensory inputs
#### Insect taste organs are distributed widely on the body
