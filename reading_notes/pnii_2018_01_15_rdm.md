## Chapter 21: Sensory coding
* **Sensory information**: neural activity originating from stimulation of receptor cells in specific parts of the body
* Philosophers of 17-19th centuries began thinking about representations of knowledge:
    * *Empiricists*: Locke, Berkeley, Hume
        * *Tabula rasa*: mind blank slate at birth, knowledge obtained through sensory experience
    * *Idealists*: Descartes, Kant, Wilhelm, Hegel
        * Knowledge based not only on sensory stimulation but also on the brain's properties that organize sensory experience

### Psychophysics relates the physical properties of stimuli to sensations
* **Psychophysics**: describes the relationship between the physical characteristics of a stimulus and the attributes of the sensory experience  
* **Sensory physiology**: examines the neural consequences of a stimulus (i.e., how it is transduced by sensory receptors and processed in the brain)

#### Psychophysical laws govern the perception of stimulus intensity
* **Just noticeable difference**: the change in strength of a stimulus (&Delta;*S*) required to notice a difference.
    * Originally defined by Weber's law, &Delta;*S* = *K*⋅*S*, where *K* is a constant.
    * Fechner extended this to the experienced intensity (*I*), with *I* = *K* log (*S*/*So*), where *So* is the *sensory threshold*.
        * This was wrong.
    * Stevens fixed Fechner, *I* = *K* (*S* – *S0*)^*n*, where *n* varies by sensory modality / region
        * E.g., sense of pressure on hand has *n* = 1
* **Sensory threshold**: lowest strength detectable stimulus (taken as 50% detection rate, see: *psychometric function*)
* **Psychometric function**: plot of stimulus detection rate (%age) as a function of intensity

#### Psychophysical measurements of sensation magnitude employ standardized protocols
* Fechner introduced three formal quantitative methods of analysis:
    1. The *method of constant stimuli*: fixed set of stimuli presented repeatedly to obtain a statistical characterization of the behavior associated with each stimulus
    2. The *method of limits*: subject reports intensity at which a progressively &darr; stimulus no longer detectable or an &uarr; stimulus detectable
    3. The *method of adjustment/reproduction*: subject adjusts a second stimulus to match or reproduce intensity of the first one
* **Magnitude estimation**: subjects verbally report intensity of experienced stimuli (introduced by Stevens)
    * *Reliability*: correlations between observers rating the same stimuli
    * *Repeatability*: correlations between responses from the same subject to similar stimuli
* Four primary **scales of measurement**:
    1. *Nominal*: items have names but no rank
        * Colors, tastes, smell
    2. *Ordinal*: ranked with logical range and ordered relationship, but intervals not comparable
        * Verbal pain report at doctor (i.e., "on 1-10 scale what is your pain?", 8 != 2 x 4)
    3. *Interval*: distances, but not ratios, have meaning
        * Estimates of position of an object on a grid map
    4. *Ratio*: rank, interval, and ratio all have valid meanings
        * Stimulus intensity scales!
        * Values generally normalized w/i subject

#### Sensations are quantified using probabilistic statistics
* Variability of evoked response can be modeled as Gaussian (normal) process (Thurstone, '27)
* Operationalized in **signal detection theory**
    * Trial-to-trial fluctuations are overlapping Gaussian processes (signal + noise)
    * *Discrimination index* (d'): difference between means of "hits" (stimulus) and "correction rejections" (noise) Gaussian processes
    * *Decision boundary* defines signal required for subject to say "yes"
    * Stimulus response matrix, where columns indicate subject response and rows indicate correct response (i.e., ground truth):
        |         | Yes            | No                |
        | ------- | -------------- | ----------------- |
        | **Yes** | Hit            | Miss              |
        | **No**  | False positive | Correct rejection |
    * Accuracy calculated as (hits + correction rejection) / # trials
    * Discriminability (d') typically plotted as a *receiver operating characteristic* (ROC) curve
        * Hits/false positives as a function of stimulus intensity (or something else), where area under curve = d'
* *Two-alternative forced-choice protocol*: two observation intervals, subject must specify which interval stimulus occurred in

#### Decision times are correlated with cognitive processes
* **Reaction time** (RT): useful measures of "certainty" in response
* Treisman visual pattern recognition tasks showed usefulness of RT in evaluating cognitive function
    * *Parallel search*: target differs in 1 property from distractors; "easy", so # of elements should have no impact on RT
    * *Serial search*: target shares &geq;2 properties with distractors; "hard", so # of elements should cause RT to increase

### Physical stimuli are represented in the nervous system by means of the sensory code
**Neural code**: describes the relationship between the activity in a specified neural population and its functional consequences for the operations that follow
* Sensory systems good models for testing this

#### Sensory receptors are responsive to a single type of stimulus energy
* **Theory of specificity**: (Bell & Müller), each neuron performs a specific task, and the train of action potentials it produces has a specific functional significance for all postsynaptic neurons.
* **Receptor potential**: amplitude + duration of electrical signal produced by receptor
    * Determined by intensity/duration of stimulus
* **Stimulus transduction**: process of converting energy into electrical signal
* **Receptor specificity**: property by which receptors are optimally selective for a single type of stimulus energy
* Human sensory receptors fall into four subclasses (1 + 2 most widespread and varied)
    1. Mechanoreceptors
    2. Chemoreceptors
    3. Photoreceptors
    4. Thermoreceptors

| Sensory system | Modality | Stimulus | Receptor class | Receptor cells |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Visual | Vision | Light (photons) | Photoreceptor | Rods and cones |
| Auditory | Hearing | Sound (pressure waves) | Mechanoreceptor | Hair cells in cochlea |
| Vestibular | Head motion | Gravity, acceleration, and head motion | Mechanoreceptor | Hair cells in vestibular labyrinths |
| Somatosensory | | | | Cranial and dorsal root ganglion cells with receptors in: |
| | Touch | Skin deformation and motion | Mechanoreceptor | Skin |
| | Proprioception | Muscle length, muscle force, and joint angle | Mechanoreceptor | Muscle spindles and joint capsules |
| | Pain | Noxious stimuli (thermal, mechanical, and chemical stimuli) | Thermoreceptor, mechanoreceptor, and chemoreceptor | All tissues except central nervous system |
| | Itch | Histamine | Chemoreceptor | Skin |
| | Visceral (not painful) |Wide range (thermal, mechanical, and chemical stimuli) | Thermoreceptor, mechanoreceptor, and chemoreceptor | Gastrointestinal tract, urinary bladder, and lungs |
| Gustatory | Taste | Chemicals | Chemoreceptor | Taste buds |
| Olfactory | Smell | Odorants | Chemoreceptor | Olfactory sensory neurons |

#### Multiple subclasses of sensory receptors are found in each sense organ
* *Submodalities* exist within each sensory system (e.g., vision has different colors, taste has bitter / sweet / salty / sour, touch has temperature / texture / rigidity)
    * This is driven by specialized receptors *tuned* to an optimal/best stimulus
        * *Tuning curves* visualize receptor sensitivities
* Combinations of specialized receptors lead to diversity of sensations

#### Neural firing patterns transmit sensory information to the brain
* Stimulus intensity converted to all-or-nothing *action potential* (AP) in receptors
    * Intensity modifies frequency/number of spikes, not amplitude
* **Receptor adaptation**: Diminishing of neural response to persistent, unchanging stimulus
    * Slowly- and rapidly-adapting receptors (respond during stimuli and when stimuli starts/stops) help codify *contrasts* in stimuli
* **Population code**: representation of stimulus driven by total # of active neurons
    * Max firing rate: 1000 spikes/s, imposed by AP refractory period
    * Low- and high-threshold receptors help extend dynamic range beyond max rate

#### The receptive field of a sensory neuron conveys spatial information
* **Receptive field**: sensory "area" in which stimuli can activate receptor/sensory neuron. **Perceptive field**: area/region from which sensation seems to arise.
    * Overlapping receptive fields codify "shape" or stimulus in neural space, termed an *isomorphic representation*
* **Rate coding**: intensity of stimulus determined by temporal firing rate of neurons
* Spatial resolution of system determined by # of sensory neurons / how receptive fields overlap
    * Dense neurons w/ small receptive fields &rarr; very detailed representations
* Spatial coding leverages parallel architecture of nervous system + temporal sensitivity of neurons
    * Sometimes operationalized as *vector codes* in mathematical spatial
* Internal representation of stimuli may be distorted from reality due to abstraction by brain

### Modality-specific pathways extend to the central nervous system
* **Sensory system**: ensemble of neurons connected to receptors responding to specific sensory modality
* Sensory information flows through complex network of convergent excitation and inhibitory neurons determined by excitatory-inhibitory receptive fields.

#### The receptor surface is represented topographically in central nuclei
* Retinotopic (visual), somatotopic (somatosensory), and tonotopic (auditory) organizations seen at lowest level of sensory processing
    * This organization decreases as information ascends processing pathways and descriptive features downplayed for properties of behavioral importance
* *Ventral* pathway from V1 to temporal lobe and hippocampus/entorhinal cortex encodes "what"
* *Dorsal* pathway from V1 to parietal lobe and motor areas of frontal cortex encodes "where"
* Ventral/dorsal streams evident in auditory (Wernicke's=comprehension vs Broca's=production) and somatosensory (ventral parietal=size/shape vs posterior parietal=size/weight/texture) systems, too

#### Feedback regulates sensory coding
* We have LOTS of control over information via changes in attention and vigilance to sensations
* Brain can also modulate responsiveness of neurons via feedback loops
    * E.g., brainstem can modulate frequency sensitivity of hair cells in cochlea

#### Top-down learning mechanisms influence sensory processing
* **Template matching**: mechanism by which only a specific pattern (template) of activation will cause a neuron to fire
* Underlies *association*: if B follows A (repeatedly), B becomes associated to A, and exposure to A evokes internal representation of B
    * How pattern recognition works, but not necessarily how the brain works
        * Current thought: isomorphic representation conveyed by sensory neurons is abstracted as it progresses through neural pathways
