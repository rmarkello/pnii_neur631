## Chapter 1: The brain and behavior

Neural science must continually confront certain fundamental questions.
Using language as a model, this chapter examines questions including:
* Is function localized to specific regions?
* What is the relationship between regions in generating complex functions?
* Are these relationships best understood at a cellular or areal level?

### Two opposing views have been advanced on the relationship between brain and behavior

Current understanding of the brain emerged from five academic disciplines:
1. Anatomy: Ram√≥n y Cajal used the Golgi method to stain nerve cells; developed the *neuron doctrine*
2. Embryology: confirmed the existence of the *growth cone* which leads developing axons to their targets
3. Physiology: nerve cells produce electricity, and measured the speed of conduction along an axon.
4. Pharmacology: drugs bind to discrete receptors located on the surface membrane of the cell.
5. Psychology: dualism tradition; Kant later advocated that our perception of the world is determined by inherent features of our mind / brain.

Gall joined biological and psychological conceptions of behavior in the study of phrenology.

Flourens used lesion studies in animals to argue that function was instead distributed throughout cortex, rather than localized as Gall had claimed.
This came to be known as a *holistic* view of brain function and was supported by established religious traditions.

Work by Broca and Wernicke challenged the holistic view, and Charles Sherrington extended their localization approach to the cellular level to champion a view known as *cellular connectionism*.

### The brain has distinct functional regions

The brain comprises seven major structures:
1. Medulla oblongata
2. Pons
3. Cerebellum
4. Midbrain
5. Diencephalon, and
6. Cerebrum

The cerebrum, specifically the cerebral cortex, supports operations responsible for our complex cognitive abilities. Two important features characterize the organization of the cerebral cortex:
1. Each hemisphere is concerned primarily with sensory and motor processes on the contralateral side of the body.
2. Although similar in appearance, the two hemispheres are neither completely symmetrical in structure nor equivalent in function.

### The first strong evidence for localization of cognitive abilities came from studies of language disorders



### Affective States Are Also Mediated by Local, Specialized Systems in the Brain
### Mental Processes Are the End Product of the Interactions Between Elementary Processing Units in the Brain
