# PNII: Olfactory System (2018-02-05, Ragsdale)
**See [pnii_2018_02_05_emd.md](pnii_2018_02_05_emd.md) for EMD's take on lecture**

### Notes on the midterm
2018-02-12, 2:30--5:30p; 50 multiple choice questions, broken down by lecture:
* Lecture 1: 10
* Lecture 2: 15
* Lectures 3/4: 15
* Lecture 5: 5
* Readings: 5  

**Required readings**: Chapters 1, 21 (except Psychophysics relates the physical properties of stimuli to sensations), 25, and 32 (except Taste)

## Olfactory system
* Chemical sense are old as *shit* &mdash; older, even!
* Humans less interested in olfaction because we're self-centered and it's a far less important sense to us than, say, dogs or rats
    * Our olfactory bulbs are *super tiny*

## Olfactory pathway
* Transduction occurs at olfactory neurons in the **olfactory epithelium** (~1-2 cm^2) on roof of nasal cavity
    * Olfactory neurons are among SLOWEST in nervous system
* Project axons through openings in **cribriform plate** to the **olfactory bulb**
    * Cranial nerve I (olfactory nerve) progresses through olfactory tract to brain
* Dendrites of olfactory neurons (bipolar cells) end where mucosa of olfactory epithelium begins
    * Axons project in opposite direction, up through cribriform plate (see above)
* **Cilia** project from olfactory neuron dendrites into **mucosa**
    * These contain receptors for odorants!
* Odorants dissolve in mucosa (potentially aided by **odorant binding proteins**) to bind to receptors  
    * Odorants *DEPOLARIZE* olfactory neurons to cause action potentials
* Olfactory neurons turnover every few months
    * Stem cells in epithelium constantly generating new neurons
    * Exposed to environment, environment = bad, need to be replaced

## Transduction process
* G-protein coupled receptors w/odorant binding sites. Odorant binding leads to:
    1. Activation of G-&alpha;olf &rarr; adenylyl cyclase
    2. Opening of cAMP-dependent cation channels
        * Photoreceptors have cGMP-depdent cation channels; *OPPOSITE* activation parameters (i.e., open in dark/closed in light versus closed at no odor/open at odor)
* ~1000 different (mouse) genes for olfactory receptor cells &rarr; ~1000 different olfactory receptors
    * Human have about same # of genes, but *most* are non-functional (sucks to suck)
* Olfactory systems interprets things in a *combinatorial* fashion (leads to our ability to interpret more than just 200 different smells)
    * Receptors have different moieties for odorant molecules
    * One odorant can activate *many* receptor neurons
* Olfactory neurons synapse onto **mitral cells** in **glomeruli**
    * Axons of mitral cells &rarr; olfactory tract
    * Smaller # of neurons synapse on **tufted cells** (less relevant for class purposes)
    * **Granule cells** provide local inhibitory connections
* Each sensory neuron only express one type of molecular receptors
    * Distributed throughout epithelium, increasing probability of detecting an odorant
    * Single glomerulus (and, therefore, mitral cell) receives input from *many* sensory neurons, all expressing same receptor type
* Activation of different combinations of mitral cells will correspond to odors of different qualities
    * This is different than, say, the somatosensory homunculus where there is a closer correspondence of peripheral and central activation

## Upstream from the olfactory bulb
* Olfactory tract projects to primary olfactory cortex (piriform cortex, olfactory tubercle, anterior olfactory nucleus)
    * Also to medial nucleus of the amygdala and entorhinal cortex
    * Notable that these are DIRECT to cortex; no thalamus routing (but some other connections do route through thalamus, see below)
* MVPA in piriform cortex different for different odors
* Piriform cortex &rarr; thalamus &rarr; orbitofrontal cortex
    * OFC involved in valence, etc. (see: basically everything)
    * Notably involved in combination of olfaction with gustatory/somatic (mouth feel) sensations producing "taste"
