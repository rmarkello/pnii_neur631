## Retinal ganglion cells
SEVENTEEN different types of ganglion cells. Three that are important for the sake of the class:
1. **Midget cells**: ~70% of ganglion cells, small receptive fields, red/green color opponent signal, sensitive to high spatial and low temporal frequencies. Synapse with parvocellular layers in the LGN (p-pathway).
2. **Parasol cells**: ~10% of ganglion cells, larger receptive fields, achromatic signal, sensitive to low spatial and high temporal frequencies. Synapse with magnocellular layers in the LGN (m-pathway).
3. **Bistratified cells**: ~8% of ganglion cells, blue/yellow color opponent signal. Synapse with koniocellular layers in the LGN (k-pathway).

Parasol, midget, and bistratified cells *all* contribute to color vision (and luminance) via relative activation of corresponding pathways.

## Lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN)
Optic nerves (ganglion axons) partially cross hemispheres at **optic chiasm** on their way to the LGN
* Left temporal and right nasal &rarr; left LGN
* Left nasal and right temporal &rarr; right LGN

Projections from retina correspond to specific layers (1--6, ventral--dorsal) of the LGN:
* Ipsilateral eye: projects to layers 2/3/5
* Controlateral eye: projects to layers 1/4/6
* **M-pathway** (parasol cells): projects to layers 1--2
* **P-pathway** (midget cells): projects to layers 3--6

**K-pathway** (bistratified cells) projects to cells *between* the layers of the LGN (koniocellular layers)

LGN neurons have on-center and off-center receptive fields

## Alternative visual pathways
~10% of projections from retina go to other regions, including:
* **Superior colliculus**: saccadic eye movements
* **Pretectum**: pupillary reflexes
* **Suprachiasmatic nucleus**: part of the hypothalamus, modulates circadian rhythms

## Visual processing in the cortex
### Thalamus &rarr; V1
**Optic radiation** tract projects from LGN to V1 (feed-forward projections), but ~10x more projections (feed-back projections) go from V1 to LGN.
* Dorsal projections: bottom half of visual world
* Ventral projections: top half of visual world

V1 corresponds to BA17 / the **calcarine sulcus**. Contains retinotopic map: lateral = fovea, medial = periphery

Different LGN pathways project to different layers of V1 (mostly to Layer IV):
* P-pathway projects to layer 4C&beta; &rarr; blobs + interblobs (layer 2/3) &rarr; ventral stream
* M-pathway projects to layer 4C&alpha; &rarr; 4B &rarr; blobs + interblobs (layer 2/3) AND dorsal stream
* K-pathway projects DIRECTLY to blobs (layers 2/3)

### Hierarchy in V1
V1 is comprised of increasing complex (groups of) cells:
1. **Simple cells**: cells in V1 that respond to specific orientations of bars of light (due to convergent input from circular receptive fields of ganglion)
2. **Orientation columns**: vertical columns of simple cells; are not simple *columns*, nor are the boundaries between the discrete---they form complex, continuous patterns on V1
3. **Blobs** (legit the name): columns of neurons that are more responsive to color, less sensitive to orientation; interspersed throughout + with *orientation columns*
4. **Ocular dominance column**: Columnar organization of V1 within which blobs/orientation columns will respond to only the contra or ipsilateral eye (see slide 67 of 3 PNII visual system, 2018 lecture)
5. **Hypercolumn**: *all* columns that respond to a given/particular region of space

Simple cells converge to provide input to:
* Complex cells: orientation selective, no inhibitory surround
* Hypercomplex cells: sensitive to other aspects e.g., bar length, motion in given direction

### Processing streams
1. Ventral stream: "what", form/color (inputs from k/p/m-pathway)
    * FFA: responds to faces (cf. [the specificity hypothesis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21752997))
        * Prosopagnosia: inability to recognize familiar faces
2. Dorsal strem: "where", location/movement (inputs from m-pathway only)
    * MT: responds to visual motion (e.g., lesion studies with random dot kinetogram tasks)

Receptive fields increase in size (and latency, and complexity) as visual streams are ascended.

**Binding problem**: no one knows how visual information is bound together to create uniform percept.
