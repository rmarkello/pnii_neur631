# PNII: Visual System I (2018-01-22)

* ~5-10 minutes on how the visual system is important and cool
    * *Lots* of evolutionary bio & "the visual system evolved for X because of Y"
* Another 5-10 minutes of optical illusions
    * ''So this is a magic trick, huh?''
    * ''Illusion, Michael. A trick is something a whore does for money or candy.''
* The eye is *legitimately* cool and emulates a camera by focusing and projecting light onto the retina in a high fidelity way, whereas visual cortex is *not* cool and fucks that up

## The retina
* Five cell types in retina
    1. *Photoreceptors*: absorb light and transduce into electrical signal
    2. *Horizontal cells*: connects photoreceptors together
    3. *Bipolar cells*: vertical mediator between photoreceptors and retinal ganglion cells (just transmission)
    4. *Amacrine cells*: connects bipolar / retinal ganglion cells together
    5. *Retinal ganglion cells*: output layer of retina; receive transformed information and project out via optic nerve to optic nucleus
* Light passes through ALL cell layers (i.e., 5 &rarr; 4 &rarr; 3 &rarr; 2 &rarr; 1) to get to the photoreceptors, because why not?
* Ten layers of the retina
    1. *Choroid*: not part of the retina (i.e., non-neuronal), located behind the photoreceptors; pigmented to prevent light bouncing around
    2. *Retinal pigment epithelium*: non-neuronal, support metabolic processes of retina
    3. *Outer limiting membrane*: non-cellular membrane
    4. *Outer nuclear layer*: photoreceptors live here
    5. *Outer plexiform layer*: synaptic layer b/w photoreceptor and intermediary neurons
    6. *Inner nuclear layer*: bipolar, horizontal, and amacrine cells live here
    7. *Inner plexiform layer*: synaptic layer b/w ganglion and intermediary neurons
    8. *Ganglion cell layer*: retinal ganglion cells live here
    9. *Nerve fiber layer*: ???? something mildly important ???? probably output of retinal ganglion cellst to optic nerve (sounds reasonable)
    10. *Inner limiting membrane*: non-cellular membrane
* Fovea: center of visual field, highest acuity

### Photoreceptors
* Two versions: rods + cones
    * **Rods**: high sensitivity, low acuity; none in fovea but highest just outside fovea; night vision
    * **Cones**: low sensitivity, high acuity; packed into fovea, none outside fovea; color vision
* Photoreceptors DO NOT fire all-or-none action potentials; graded membrane potentials
* Photons *hyper-polarize* photoreceptor by closing cGMP-gated cation channel
    * Not a cell biology course (*THANK GOD*) so this is less important
* Two keys things to remember
    1. Ultimate outcome of light on photoreceptor: **closing** of Na+ ion channel via hyper-polarization
    2. Don't propagate action potentials: membrane potential is **graded**, depends on how much light it absorbs

#### Photoreceptor &rarr; Bipolar cell &rarr; Ganglion pathway
* In the dark: cone (photoreceptor) is depolarized; lots of Glu being released, which hyperpolarizes connected bipolar cell
    * Glu is inhibitory at the photoreceptor--bipolar cell synapse (because receptors on bipolar cell are G-protein coupled, not NMDA/AMPA)
    * Bipolar cells also have graded membrane potentials; synapse onto retinal ganglion cell
        * Glu is excitatory at the bipolar cell--retinal ganglion synapse
* In light: cone is hyperpolarized, bipolar cell is depolarized, ganglion cells is depolarized, increased firing rate
* Horizontal cells are inhibitory: they inhibit Glu release at the photoreceptor--bipolar cell synapse
    * These *inhibit* neighboring photoreceptors, reducing firing rate of (neighboring) ganglion cell

#### Receptive fields
* Receptive fields: ganglion cells receive complex, convergent input from photoreceptors/bipolar cells
    * **On-center-off-surround receptive field**: center photoreceptor has traditional inhibitory synapse with bipolar cell. See also: **lateral inhibition**
    * **Off-center-on-surround receptive field**: center photoreceptor has an excitatory synapse with bipolar cell, reversing the "normal" pathway
* In the fovea, each cone is connected to two bipolar cells and forms the center of an on-centered *and* an off-centered pathway
* Receptive fields predispose visual system to *edges* & *boundaries*
